# Scrybble remarks

With Remarks, you can export notebooks and PDFs from your ReMarkable.

1. Export your notebooks as PDF
2. Extract highlights as text

## Install

Remarks is designed and developed for Linux. There are no Remarks binaries.

1. [Install nix](https://determinate.systems/posts/determinate-nix-installer/)
2. `nix develop` to work on remarks
3. `nix run .#` to run remarks

If you don't want to use Nix, you can use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and install the dependencies manually.

## Install as docker image 

You can also use Docker to run Remarks without installing dependencies on your host system.

Use the `remarks-docker.sh` to run remarks within docker. If not existing, the script will build the docker image for you.

```sh
./remarks-docker.sh [--ssh-sync-before] <input-files> <output-directory>> <remarks-arguments>
```

## Functionality

- Convert a ReMarkable notebook to PDF
- Extract highlights to (Obsidian-compatible) markdown
